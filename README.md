## Functionality to implement: (30 Points)

---

**Milestone 1: (10 Points)**

1. Implement UI as shown in the designs ( `image 1` & `image 2` )
2. Identify, create & render React components (`Search`, `Basic User Card`, `Details User Card` as a modal )
3. Fetch from API and render a dynamic list of `Basic User Cards`
4. Show `Details User Card` as a modal when a user clicks on one of the listed cards

**Milestone 2: (10 Points)**

1. Implement search functionality using the `name` parameter of the API
2. Dynamically update list of `Basic User Cards` as user types into the search input

**Milestone 3: (10 Points)**

1. Show a paginated list of `Basic User Cards`
2. Implement pagination as an infinite scroll

## Helpful implementation notes:

---

1. API calls should be debounced
2. Memoization of API calls
3. Use Intersection observer API to implement lazy loading and infinite scroll

## Project evaluation criteria:

---

1. Every milestone you complete will award you certain points.
2. Points will be awarded based on:
    1. Quality of code
    2. Your ability to understand and implement a design as UI
    3. Your understanding of components and how you structure them & make them re-usable
    4. Optimisation of Network calls & re-renders
    5. How you structure your application state and share data across components
    6. Your ability to choose the right Third-party libraries to speed up progress while ensuring performance

## Submission guidelines:

3. Try your best to implement **all 3 milestones**
4. Put it on Github with a Github URL (Create a Github repository with your project)
5. Please do not use **'getsupp'** in the repository name else your code might be used by others.
